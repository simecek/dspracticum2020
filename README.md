# Data Science Practicum 2020

This is a proposal for a Data Science course to be taught at the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, in the fall semester 2020/2021.  

I expect to give 12 lectures, each focused on one dataset (typically from [kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com)) and one data science technique. The emphasis should be on coding and practicing data science skills, not the theoretical background.

## Course Info

The course is now in the [IS Course Catalogue](https://is.muni.cz/), look for [M7DataSP](https://is.muni.cz/auth/course/sci/podzim2020/M7DATASP) Data Science Practicum (Praktikum z pokročilé datové vědy). 

The course is scheduled for **Mondays, 12:00-13:30**, and will be taught remotely through Google Meet/Hangouts. The first lecture will take place on **October 5**. To be invited to the classes, enroll to the course in [IS](https://is.muni.cz/). If you want to try a few first lectures without a formal enrollment, send me [an email](https://www.muni.cz/lide/244334-petr-simecek).

No special knowledge is expected but you should have at least one year of coding experience, either in R or Python. I like diverse crowds; students from different faculties and specializations are encouraged to enroll (if still in doubt, let me know to be paired with more experienced students). The course will be taught in English if at least two students will be interested, otherwise in Czech.

## Lectures 

  1. **Linear regression** [[data]], git and GitHub
  1. **Logistic regression**, splitting data into train, validation and testing sets
  1. **Unsupervised methods**, visualizations
  1. **Trees and forests**
  1. **XGBoost & friends**
  1. **Review**
  1. **TensorFlow, Keras, neural networks**
  1. **Fine-tuning, transfer learning**
  1. **Classification of images**
  1. **Neural networks applied to natural language processing**
  1. **Neural networks applied to tabular data**
  1. **Collaborative filtering**

## Scoring and credits

50% homeworks (by group of 2-4 students), 50% final project (individual). To pass, you must achieve at least 60% points.
